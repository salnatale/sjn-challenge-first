# Referral Network Challenge

## Parts

1. **Graph** - Acyclic referral network (no self-referrals, one referrer per candidate)
2. **Influence** - Rank by reach and flow centrality
3. **Growth** - Expected network size with capacity limits
4. **Incentive** - Minimum bonus to reach target size

pytest test_referral.py -v
```
